<h3 title="THIS NUMBER"></h3>

<p>We place before our readers in this issue of our magazine a
considerable number of communications on the subject of temperance.
We believe, our missionaries are in the best possible position to
reach not only the children but adults, and to train them in habits
of virtue and sobriety. We have from the first put great stress
on the importance of abstinence from the use of alcoholic drinks
and tobacco, and the encouraging reports given herewith indicate
the success we have achieved. We publish also a concert exercise
relating chiefly to temperance work in the missions of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
It is our purpose to issue this in an eight-page circular which
will contain the recitations in full, and the words and music of
the Jubilee song known as <cite>Rise and Shine</cite>. The circular will be
illustrated with cuts. Further particulars are given in connection
with the concert exercise on another page.</p>

<h3>BUREAU OF WOMAN’S WORK.</h3>

<p>It has become an axiom in missionary work that no race can be
lifted out of ignorance and degradation except as its women are
elevated. One of the marked features of this age in mission work
is the clearness with which this is seen and the enthusiastic and
successful efforts put forth by the noble women of the churches
in this behalf. It is not merely the money which these efforts
bring to the missionary societies, but the zeal for the conversion
of the world infused by them into the church and the home. The
Christian mother catches the enthusiasm, and the children feel its
inspiration. Missionary education becomes the life-work in the
family.</p>

<p>The American Missionary Association has from the outset realized
the indispensable need of the elevation of woman in its work in
the South, among the Indians, and, as far as possible, among
the Chinese at the West.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a> Its workers, largely women, have been
specially adapted to it. The lady teachers have reached not merely
the girls in their schools, but the mothers in their homes. The
lady missionaries have labored for the purification of the home
through direct visits, in mothers’ meetings, in industrial work
taught to the girls, in the Sunday-school, and in temperance work.
We have become so impressed with the importance and success of
this part of our work that we are constrained to give it a broader
basis and a more thorough organization. Our aim is not only to do
more work for woman, but to give the Christian ladies of the North
and West more full information as to the way in which they can
co-operate with us. We wish to show that not only in varied ways,
but with small sums of money they can reach the women for whom we
labor.</p>

<p>To attain these results the Executive Committee of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. has
organized a <span class="smcap">Bureau of Woman’s Work</span>. The object is:</p>

<p>1. To give information to the ladies in the churches of the variety
of work now sustained by the Association, and to assist in devising
plans of help.</p>

<p>2. To promote correspondence with churches, Sabbath-schools,
missionary societies, or individuals, who will undertake work of a
special character, such as the support of missionaries, aiding of
students, supplying clothing, furnishing goods, and meeting other
wants on mission ground.</p>

<p>3. To send to the Churches, Conferences or Associations desiring it
some of our experienced and intelligent lady missionaries, who can
address them giving fuller details of our methods.</p>

<p>We believe that such a Bureau will meet a felt want and be welcomed
by the earnest Christian women of the country. The selection of
the head of the Bureau will be made and announced soon, and in the
meantime inquiries can be addressed to Bureau of Woman’s Work,
American Missionary Association, 56 Reade street, New York.</p>

<h3 title="MOZART SOCIETY OF FISK UNIVERSITY"></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mozart Society of Fisk University tendered a
complimentary concert to the members of the Tennessee Legislature.
The invitation was accepted; and on the evening of March 15, the
members with their ladies, and other friends to the number of
three or four hundred, filled the University chapel. The concert
was excellent, and the guests were deeply impressed. Complimentary
speeches were made at the close by the Speaker of the House and
the President of the Senate; and both houses afterwards passed
a resolution of thanks. One member sought an introduction to
President Cravath after the concert, saying, “This evening marks an
era in my life. You have converted me on the negro question.” Much
credit is due to the Mozart Society and to Prof. Spence for the
manner in which the whole entertainment was rendered.</p>

<h3 title="COMMITTEE ON CONSTITUTION"></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> our last annual meeting, held in Cleveland, a committee
was appointed to report amendments to the Constitution of this
Association. The Committee consisted of Hon. Wm. B. Washburn, Rev.
G.&nbsp;M. Boynton, A.&nbsp;L. Williston, Esq., Rev. W.&nbsp;T. Eustis, D.D.,
Rev. A.&nbsp;H. Plumb, D.D., of Mass., Austin Abbott, Esq., John H.

T. Collins, of Ohio, Rev. A.&nbsp;H. Ross, of Mich., Rev. F.&nbsp;A. Noble,
D.D., of Illinois. Feb. 21, the above Committee met at the rooms of
this Association, all the members being present except Drs. Noble
and Chamberlain, who were detained by sickness in their households.</p>

<p>After protracted discussion and the earnest advocacy of various
views, the Committee unanimously agreed to report a draft of
a Constitution, which we give elsewhere in this number of the
<span class="smcap">Missionary</span>. The Committee will submit the Proposed
Constitution to the different State Conferences and Associations
for action in accordance with the instructions given at the annual
meeting.</p>

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>


<h4>AFRICA.</h4>

<p>—There is thought of founding at Natal an industrial and
agricultural school for the natives.</p>

<p>—Efforts are being made for the erection of a machine for the
manufacture of fire-water at Bailunda, West Central Africa.
Christians! which shall the poor negro have first, strong drink or
the gospel?</p>

<p>—The missionaries of the Livingstone Inland Mission have
multiplied their stations along the lower Congo. Invited by several
chiefs along the left bank of the river, they have founded one at
Kimorie, another upon the same river and on the other side of the
Loukoungou.</p>

<p>—Mr. C. Gregory has started to explore the regions east of
Abyssinia. From Khartoum he went up upon the Abyssinian plateau,
from whence he descended toward the territory inhabited by the
Afars and traversed by the Gualima and the Melli rivers, flowing
from the Haowasch.</p>

<p>—A society has been established at London under the title of the
Congo and Central African Company, with a capital of 250,000 livres
sterling, to traffic along the western side of Africa, especially
upon the Congo, using the road constructed by Stanley.</p>

<p>—A letter from Cairo announces that Mr. Wissmann had arrived in
that city the first of January. Between the lake Moucambe and
Nyangoué, he passed through the territory of a tribe of dwarf
negroes. From lake Tanganyika to Zanzibar, his journey was made
without great difficulty, owing to the aid given by Mirambo.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE CHINESE.</h4>

<p>—The Methodist Episcopal Church has founded a university at Japan,
through the liberality of Rev. Mr. Goucher, of Baltimore. The
Theological Seminary has been removed from Yokohama to Tokio, and
incorporated with it.</p>

<p>—The Presbyterian Board is about to open a new mission in China,
in the province of Shautung. It will be located at Wei Hein, a city
midway between Tsinan and Tungchon. There will be three laborers.
There are now forty missionaries of all denominations in the
province, among a population of 30,000,000.</p>

<p>—An Anti-Opium Prayer Union has been formed in Great Britain, of
which the members residing in different parts covenant to pray at

<h3>ALABAMA CONFERENCE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY PRES. H.&nbsp;S. DE FOREST, D.D.</p>

<p>The Cong. S.&nbsp;S. Association held its fourth, and the State
Conference its eighth, annual meeting in the chapel at Talladega
from the 23d to the 28th of March. This body, hereafter to be known
as the Congregational Association of Alabama, numbers thirteen
Churches, two in the northern part of the State being associated
with the Central South Conference of Tennessee. Seven of these
fifteen Alabama churches have grown out of Talladega College.
Naturally the desire to see the mother church was strong, and more
than eighty delegates and guests were in attendance. From beyond
the State, we had Supt. Roy, Rev. A.&nbsp;E. Dunning of Boston and Mrs.
A.&nbsp;S. Steele of Chattanooga, to each of whom the Conference is
indebted for efficient help. Sec. Dunning, the first of all our
society secretaries to visit the body, preached a sermon before
the Sunday-school Association good enough and fervid enough to
direct much of the thought of the four days that followed. His
theme was “The Holy Ghost the Source of Power,” and while much
in these meetings was delightful, nothing gave such hallowed
experiences or left such tender memories as the manifest presence
of God. Some thought they were breathing a revival atmosphere, and
one, it is hoped, who took that occasion to visit a daughter in
college, will regard Talladega as the Damascus gate. Other sermons
were by Rev. R.&nbsp;C. Bedford of Montgomery, by Rev. O.&nbsp;D. Crawford
of Mobile, before the sacrament, and by Dr. Roy at the ordination
of Rev. J.&nbsp;R. Sims of Shelby Iron Works, one of the sons of this
theological department and Church. These sermons were spoken and
not read. The aim of the preachers was evidently to do good on the
spot and at that time. There was little talk about the new light,
but a profound conviction that in these dark places there is need
of the light of the Gospel. The programme had been prepared with
a practical intent. Different phases of the Sunday-school work
took the strength of the first day. One evening was given to the
Sunday-school and Publishing Society and the American Missionary
Association, when the speakers were Sec. Dunning and Dr. Roy.
Another evening was devoted to missions, home and foreign. The
addresses were by Rev. A.&nbsp;W. Curtis and Rev. C.&nbsp;B. Curtis, who
have a brother in the foreign field, and one of whom was a home
missionary before coming South.</p>

<p>Such themes as Giving and Worship, Through what Societies—not
less than seven it was claimed, Is our Worship too Formal and
Unimpassioned, Temperance Economy and Industrial Education, were
well presented and discussed. Prof. Ellis read a very suggestive
paper on the Reciprocal Relation of the College to the Churches
of Alabama. The recommendations of this paper were indorsed by
special resolutions, and it is evident that Talladega College,
first and foremost<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a> among the schools open to Freedmen in Alabama,
was never more strongly intrenched in the love of the brethren than
now. Two hundred and ninety pupils have been in attendance during
the last year, and new buildings and appliances are called for.
Many and tender references were made to Prof. Andrews, temporarily
absent from ill-health, and he was a dull observer who could attend
these meetings, look upon these ministers, delegates, students and
graduates of the College, hear their words and drink their spirit,
and not feel that work in these reconstructing States is as heroic,
as hopeful, as imperative as any done in the great vineyard of the
Lord.</p>

<h3>LOUISIANA ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<h4>Annual Meeting at New Iberia, La.</h4>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. W.&nbsp;S. ALEXANDER, D.D.</p>

<p>This is the seventh annual meeting of this association I have
attended, and I am glad to be able to say that for sustained
interest, for vigorous thought expressed in the discussions, and
for wise planning for the future, the meeting of this year outranks
the previous ones. This is as it should be. It shows a degree of
study and fidelity on the part of the ministers which promises well
for the churches.</p>

<p>We are always glad to come to this beautiful Teche country. These
broad prairies are fertile as a garden. The soil is so easy of
cultivation, and yields such abundant harvests, and its market
value is so low, that it is within the power of every industrious
man to be a “proprietor of the soil,” and to own his homestead.
That is what the colored people are doing in this garden district
of the State, and it tells upon the character of the people and the
respect which they claim from the community.</p>

<p>It has been a year of quiet growth in most of the churches. Central
Church of New Orleans reports the largest accession, 46, of whom 40
came on profession of faith—the ingathering of the revival of last
winter. Some of the churches have been repaired and beautified;
debts have been paid off, or greatly reduced; disturbing elements
have been eliminated, and the way opened for a larger and more
healthful growth in the coming year.</p>

<p>One new church has been organized at Belle Place, near New Iberia,
and by the timely help of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. will soon put up a tasteful
chapel, and will become, we hope, the center of religious influence
for a large colored population. Mr. Samson, the white planter,
encourages the enterprise by kind words and generous donations.</p>

<p>There are other open doors which we should enter at once. We can
hear the word of command: “Go up and possess the land.” How much
good a little financial aid would do just now in the beginning of
church enterprises, which, by God’s help, would grow into important
centers of good for the race.</p>

<p>I believe so thoroughly in the comity of churches, that where
the field is already occupied by other churches, and vigorously
cultivated by them, and the religious needs of the people are met,
I would not favor the establishment of another church, though its
creed and polity were more to our inclination. But the field is so
broad, and the destitution so great, that there is room for the
expenditure of the largest sympathy and the most vigorous effort
toward church enlargement. This missionary spirit was felt by the
Association, and the session of most tender interest was the last,
when the broad subject of missions was presented by eight speakers
selected by the business committee. The meeting had a glow to it
that was refreshing. Every one seemed to catch the inspiration and
to respond heartily to it.</p>

<p>Our field agent, Dr. Roy, always welcome, and always charged with
just the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a> message which these churches and brethren need, brought
to us again this year, vigorous words, wise counsels, and the
kindest, most sympathetic spirit. Our association would hardly seem
complete without him.</p>

<p>Thus another year of effort, of struggle and of self-denial for
Christ, has left its record upon the churches, and has, we trust,
made a record in heaven, which we shall be willing to meet.</p>

<h4>TEMPERANCE WORK IN MISSIONS OF A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</h4>

<p>Singing. “Dare to do right. Dare to be true.”</p>

<p>Responsive Readings.</p>

<p>Leader. “Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons
with thee when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest
ye die; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.”
Lev. 10:9.</p>

<p>Girls. And the angel of the Lord said to the mother of Sampson:
“Thou shalt bear a son. Beware and drink not wine nor strong drink;
for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God to the day of his
death.” Judges 13:3, 4, 7.</p>

<p>Boys. “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab, the son of Rachab, our
father, commanded us, saying, ye shall drink no wine, neither ye
nor your sons forever.” Jer. 35:6.</p>

<p>Leader. “It is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes strong
drink.” Prov. 31:4.</p>

<p>Girls. “Lest they drink and forget law and pervert the judgment of
any of the afflicted.” Prov. 31:5.</p>

<p>Boys. “Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of
nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength and not for
drunkenness.” Eccl. 10:17.</p>

<p>Leader. “They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall
be bitter to them that drink it.” Isa. 24:9.</p>

<p>Girls. “For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; and
drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.” Prov. 23:21.</p>

<p>Boys. “Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.” I Cor. 6:10.</p>

<p>Leader. “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who
hath babblings? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
eyes?” Prov. 23:29.</p>

<p>Girls. “They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek
mixed wine.” Prov. 23:30.</p>

<p>Boys. “At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an
adder.” Prov. 23:32.</p>

<p>Leader. “But now I have written unto you, not to keep company, if
any man that is called a brother be an idolater, or a railer, or a
drunkard; with such a one, no, not to eat.” I Cor. 5:11.</p>

<p>Girls. “Restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.” Gal. 6:1.</p>

<p>Boys. “Young men likewise, exhort to be sober minded.” Titus 2:6.</p>

<p>Leader. “And every man that striveth for the mastery, is temperate
in all things.” I Cor. 9:25.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></p>

<p>Girls. “Therefore let us not sleep as do others; but let us watch
and be sober.” I Thes. 5:6.</p>

<p>Boys. “For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be
drunken, are drunken in the night.” I Thes. 5:7.</p>

all to the glory of God.” 1 Cor. 10:31.</p>

<p>Prayer.</p>

<div class="article">
<h4>POSITION SUSTAINED BY A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.</h4>

<p>Leader. What has been the attitude of the American Missionary
Association since its organization in 1846 on the temperance
question?</p>

<p>Girls. It has always taken a decided stand against the use and the
sale of intoxicating drink.</p>

<p>Boys. Its missionaries have been instructed to advocate the
cause of temperance, and to organize societies to promote total
abstinence from the use of alcoholic drink.</p>

<p>Leader. Does the Association assist missionaries, or students, who
refuse to abstain from the use of ardent spirits?</p>

<p>Girls. It is the rule of the Society in its work among the Indians,
the Chinese in America, and the Negroes at the South, to employ
only those who have good habits and settled convictions on all
moral subjects, including that of temperance.</p>

<p>Boys. In its collegiate and normal schools, where there are large
numbers of boarding students, all are required to observe habits of
total abstinence.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>TEMPERANCE WORK AMONG INDIANS.</h4>

<p>Leader. Have the Indians been subject to peculiar temptations to
intemperance?</p>

<p>Girls. Yes. On many of the reservations, our agents complain that
whiskey is a great curse. At the Leech Lake Agency, six Indians
were killed in drunken quarrels among themselves in six months.</p>

<p>Boys. Rev. Myron Eells, of Washington Territory, says he convicted
quite a number of persons for selling liquor to the Indians, which
aroused the fierce opposition of the whiskey ring, which had done
its utmost to prevent his success.</p>

<p>Leader. What has resulted from efforts for their reformation?</p>

<p>Girls. So much was accomplished by Rev. Mr. Spees and his wife at
Red Lake, that not a drunken Indian had been seen for many weeks.</p>

<p>Boys. At the Skokomish Agency, about 130 Indians took the
temperance pledge. Since then those who came under the influence of
the missionary abandoned the use of strong drink. The opposition,
however, by the liquor sellers was such that they burned seven
Indian houses by way of retaliation.</p>

<p>Leader. Do Indian youth readily accept temperance principles when
brought into the training schools of the Association?</p>

<p>Girls. They do. Those brought to Hampton by Capt. Pratt gave up
their tobacco and whiskey during the first year, held prayer
meetings together, and pursued the industrial occupations required
by the school without serious objection.</p>

<p>Boys. At the Green Bay Agency, within a few years, a great work has
been done in the way of temperance reform, so that Mr. Wheeler, the
missionary on the ground, says that a more temperate community of
its size cannot probably be found in the State of Wisconsin.</p>

<div class="article">
<h4>TEMPERANCE WORK AMONG THE CHINESE.</h4>

<p>Leader. Are the Chinese on the Pacific Coast exposed to temptations
to intemperance?</p>

<p>Girls. Gen. C.&nbsp;H. Howard, writing from Sacramento, says: At their
groceries, liquors are always to be found. The older persons have a
prevalent habit of constantly smoking opium when in from their work.</p>

<p>Boys. The increase of traffic in opium in the United States has
been very great during the past twenty years, which is no doubt
partly accounted for from the presence of the Chinese.</p>

<p>Leader. Do Christian influences make the Chinamen better?</p>

<p>Girls. At an annual festival in Sacramento, a converted Chinaman
said of the converts among his countrymen: “Oh yes, all much better
men, do not steal, do not gamble, do not do any bad, no opium,
some not even smoke cigars. We can tell, all other Chinamen watch
Christian Chinamen. When he is converted and believes truth, it
makes him good inside. He don’t want to go wrong anymore. If all
Chinamen be Christians then no more trouble about ‘must go.’”</p>

<p>Boys. Among the 2,567 Chinese students in the schools of the
American Missionary Association last year, religious work was very
encouraging. About one in ten of those who came under the influence
of the society are converted. These abandon their evil habits as
readily as converts among other races.</p>

<div class="article">
<h4>TEMPERANCE WORK AMONG THE COLORED PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH.</h4>

<p>Leader. Are temptations to intemperance common among the colored
people?</p>

<p>Girls. Yes. More so now, than in the days of slavery. When slaves,
it was not for the interest of their masters to furnish them strong
drink as a beverage, and the Negroes had but little opportunity or
money to purchase it for themselves.</p>

<p>Boys. They now have the privilege of working for wages, and most of
the grocery stores as well as the saloons keep liquor, and are glad
to get the Negro’s money for it.</p>

<p>Leader. Are there not laws in the different Southern States,
prohibiting the sale of intoxicating drinks to minors and to
drunken persons?</p>

<p>Girls. There are in quite a number of those States, but these laws
are not often enforced.</p>

<p>Boys. In some States they have local option laws in which the
counties can vote prohibition, and when temperance measures are
carried it is largely the result of Negro votes.</p>

<p>Leader. Has the American Missionary Association found an open door
for temperance work in its missions South?</p>

<p>Girls. It has. Some years the pupils in attendance have numbered
40,000, among whom were persons of all ages.</p>

<p>Boys. Not unfrequently the enthusiasm for establishing temperance
societies has been very great. Middle-aged and gray-haired men and
women have eagerly sought to enter the Bands of Hope established
by the children, and when admitted have been lifted up from their
vices and advanced in sobriety and usefulness.</p>

<p>Leader. Can you give some statements relating to the work in
particular missions?</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></p>

<p>Girls. At Talladega, Ala., they have a Union Temperance
Society, which holds monthly meetings full of interest. All the
Sunday-school and all the College students are members. They keep
the work lively among all their mission schools.</p>

<p>Boys. At Marion, Ala., there is a regular temperance catechising
in the day-school against rum and tobacco, also in three mission
Sunday-schools. For several weeks before Christmas, mass meetings
are held in different churches, at which addresses are made on the
subject.</p>

<p>Leader. Are the churches of the Association committed to the cause
of temperance?</p>

<p>Girls. They are. Many of the churches have distinctive rules,
requiring abstinence from the use as a beverage of intoxicating
drinks, and forbidding the selling of such.</p>

<p>Boys. The churches and conferences of the Association are
practically temperance societies. They hold temperance as an
article of their faith and undertake to exercise discipline on that
principle.</p>

<p>Leader. Are they peculiar in their treatment of the subject of
temperance?</p>

<p>Girls. They differ from many churches South in this particular. A
pastor in Savannah writes: “No one can tell the importance of these
Congregational organizations here except those on the ground. Our
church has taken an open bold stand against liquor drinking and
liquor traffic. Our little temperance society has become a power in
the city and surrounding country. It has provoked others to good
works. Two other societies have been organized in the city and one
at Belmont.”</p>

<p>Boys. At Childersburg, Ala., Rev. A. Jones had his church burned
after giving a temperance lecture, but instead of surrendering, his
people have rallied and they are building better than before.</p>

<p>Leader. What has been the success of the work for temperance in the
Sunday-schools of the Association?</p>

<p>Girls. Among the 7,000 scholars in the Sunday-schools, a very
encouraging work has been carried on year by year. Bands of Hope
have been organized and temperance gatherings held and pledges
signed by a very large number of children.</p>

<p>Boys. Mr. Curtis writes from Alabama as follows: “Temperance at
Anniston booming. The whole country thoroughly aroused. Temperance
taught in the Sunday-school. Band of Hope meetings, temperance
prayer-meetings and mass meetings with lectures and discussions.”</p>

<p>Leader. Do those who go forth from the schools of the Association
to teach and preach promote the cause of temperance?</p>

<p>Girls. They do. Over 150 who were converted to the cause of
temperance while at Tougaloo, Miss., signed the pledge and did
temperance work in connection with the teaching in the common
schools, and in various other ways.</p>

<p>Boys. During a single year the total number of signers to the
pledge obtained by the students connected with one of the
institutions of the Association was 1,300. The teachers sent forth
from the normal classes exert great influence, not only in the
schools where they give instruction, but also among their friends
and neighbors in the localities where they carry on their work.</p>

<h4>THINGS NEEDFUL.</h4>

<p>Leader. What is needful in order that the American Missionary
Association may succeed in its great work among the Indians,
Chinese and Negroes?</p>

<h3>TEMPERANCE WORK IN CHURCHES.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. JOS. E. ROY, D.D.</p>

<p>Our Churches, Conferences and Associations are practically
temperance societies. Many of the churches have distinctive rules
requiring abstinence from the use as a beverage, and from the
selling, of intoxicating drinks. As new churches are organized they
are more and more inclined to start with a special, stringent rule.
Other churches interpret, as requiring the same, the common law
of their covenant, by which the members “promise to walk with the
disciples in love, and denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts,
to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.” All
hold temperance as an article of their faith, expect to have it
faithfully preached in their pulpits, and undertake to exercise
discipline on that principle.</p>

<p>In connection with many of our churches, Bands of Hope were early
organized; and these have done great good in bringing up the rising
generation in the way of sobriety. Some of these have shown great
effectiveness and great tenacity of existence. Some have gained
property and have become permanent fountains of blessing.</p>

<p>In the old times the master’s will was a prohibitory law to his
slaves. When that law was repealed, to many liberty seemed to imply
freedom to drink as much whiskey as they pleased. Experience has
been teaching them better. The means used for their moral elevation
have taken effect upon the prevalence of this habit. But still
liquor drinking is the devil’s best hold upon this people. And
so perpetual vigilance is required to meet these satanic wiles,
even within the precincts of the church. But our pastors have been
faithful, and the churches have been ready to respond to right
principle in the execution of discipline. In a rice-swamp region,
where the whiskey shops seem to be the regular attendants of the
old-time churches, standing hard by the same and finding the
Sabbaths their best<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a> days of business, our church there has no such
an annex, for it furnishes no such patronage.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, during the great canvass for prohibition in that
State, one of our pastors was surprised to find laxity in principle
and practice among his members on this subject. He took hold of the
matter vigorously. Church meetings were held. Discussion ran high
until stringent rules were enacted and the members brought into
line to vote for the prohibitory law. When that election came off
and the mass of the colored people shamefully joined with the enemy
and voted against the constitutional inhibition, our pastors and
churches were firm and solid on the right side—our pastor at the
Capital being on the State Executive Committee along with the first
citizens of the State and doing valiant service at home and afield
for the reform.</p>

<p>Our Conferences and Associations, at their annual meetings, have
temperance almost as a standing subject for discussions and for
public meetings. An evening is often spent in ten-minute addresses.
In these the laymen prove very effective speakers. These bodies are
diligent in urging upon the churches fidelity as to the preaching,
practice and discipline upon the subject of temperance.</p>

<h3>HINDRANCES.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. DANA SHERRILL, SAVANNAH, GA.</p>

<p>The hindrance occasioned by intemperance in connection with
our work, in church and school, differs only in intensity from
similar evil found elsewhere. The social and spiritual atmosphere
is depressing to our work, because of drinking habits. Total
abstainers number less than ten per cent. of our population, all
colors. A well-informed colored man assures me that not one in
a hundred among men between 18 and 45 years of age are, in his
judgment, total abstainers. Of arrests by our city police during
the year 1882, 1,460 were for offenses usually arising more or less
directly from drink, against 538 for all other crimes and 536 for
drunkenness only. Drinking on our field is not yet driven to the
dramshops, but is common in homes. A father is known to drink every
day in the presence of his children. His name is Legion. The shops
are closed in many country places hereaway where there is little
total abstinence. The demijohn is all-present. The way-trains out
of our city are whiskey trains. Of fourteen men in a car with your
missionary recently, twelve drank spirits from one to four times in
an hour.</p>

<p>At present the great majority of influential people are not only
<em>not</em> total abstainers, but by example and often by precept teach
our colored people, who naturally pattern after the ruling class,
that drinking is the correct thing. This is a sample hindrance.
A promising convert <a id="Err1" name="Err1"></a>was found to be giving intoxicating drink to
wife and children. When remonstrance was made he asked: “How can it
be wrong when my employer, a good church member, makes me pass it
to his guests every day?” It is needless to say that he is still
outside the church.</p>

<p>Here the general church opinion does not demand total abstinence;
in fact, rebels against such a doctrine. Until very recently the
ministers of our colored churches in no case known to me would be
able to enforce anything like total abstinence however earnestly
they might desire so to do. This, then, is the atmosphere in which
your agents and a very small but earnest band of fellow-helpers
are attempting to build churches and schools demanding total
abstinence. An ignorant, but careful mother, said only a few days
since: “I don’t know but I must leave my church and come over to
you, there is no other temperance church here.” This<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a> after one
of our usual monthly total abstinence meetings, and she added as
reason, “I never knew drunkards could not go to heaven before.”
Standing, then, as our church has, as the only religious society
refusing continued membership to drinking men and women, and that
in the presence of the spirit and customs named, it is not strange
that we have been opposed by the uninstructed as interfering with
their liberties, and righteous over much. One at least of our small
churches finds the “social unions” and similar societies, which are
very numerous, almost breaking up their Sabbath service once each
month. The charm in these society meetings is the <em>wine provided</em>.</p>

<h3>THE TEMPERANCE OUTLOOK AT MEMPHIS.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY PROF. A.&nbsp;J. STEELE.</p>

<p>“It was in evidence to-day that Marianna’s place was going full
blast all day Sunday last, and that it was crowded with men and
boys, some of them not more than twelve years old, shooting dice
and playing cards. The specific charges against him were keeping
house open, selling liquor on that day, and allowing minors to
gamble.”</p>

<p>The above item, taken from a late daily paper of this city, may
serve to introduce my observations in the matter of temperance—or
rather of intemperance—for the ten years of my life at Memphis.
The place above referred to is prominently located, rather to one
side of the business portion of the city, and almost literally
within the very shadows of two of the largest colored churches
of the city. If there exists now in Memphis any distinctively
temperance organization other than the W.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;U. and the Band
of Hope of Le Moyne Institute, I can find nothing of it. If
the churches speak with other than very uncertain tones on the
subject, when they speak at all, I am not aware of it. I know of
but one church, the Second Congregational, that makes abstinence a
condition of membership. I know of many whose members may and do
drink steadily, sometimes to drunkenness, unmolested. If there is
any practical or emphatic or systematic teaching in Sunday-schools
in general on the subject, I have not known of it. Strangely
enough, our strongest, most effective temperance sentiment and
teaching comes through the courts, and through business men and
interests, where in the majority of cases no moral responsibility
or solicitude is felt or expressed in the matter in question.</p>

<p>The legal argument and phase of the subject is the one that most
readily finds a hearing and a following here; this was recently
shown by the marked interest manifested in several able addresses
given on the subject by Mrs. Foster, the lawyer-temperance
advocate of Iowa. In the South, at all events, there is no doubt
as to the <em>right</em> or <em>power</em> of legislative bodies and courts to
deal with the matter. By a curious mistake some years since the
General Assembly of Tennessee passed a law known as the “Four Mile
Law,” which prohibits the sale of liquor within four miles of any
chartered institution of learning. It was supposed that the law
would be of only local force, but it so happened that the State
Constitution declared that any general act of the Legislature must
be of general application throughout the State. Hence in time we
came to realize that we had a very effective prohibitory law, or
what amounted to that. To the everlasting honor of our courts it
must be said that this and such other temperance legislation as we
have is fearlessly enforced and under very severe penalties in such
cases as are presented for trial.</p>

<p>This is, to say the least, a very anomalous condition of affairs.
I account for it in two ways, chiefly from the fact that in
general the liquor interests of the South<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a> are poorly organized
and consolidated for any purposes of opposition or defense;
and secondly, in communities where the formative process is
largely going on—(and be assured the new South will not be the
old)—especially in all questions of public import, the <em>heroic</em> is
oftener resorted to than is just common or fashionable in a more
settled state of society. There is less allowing of quibbles and
more coming straight to the end in view. So stringently have the
courts applied these laws that there are several counties in East
Tennessee where no liquor is now sold.</p>

<p>In this county many country liquor stores have been run out, a
fine of $150 being not unusual for a first offense in violation
of law; this was the fine inflicted in the instance at the head
of this letter. In general the newspapers cast their influence on
the right side; usually edited by men of position and at least
of local importance, their influence is not small. In Memphis
the W.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;U. is the strong moral force for temperance work
and influence. Concerning our own work, Colman’s Temperance text
book, is regularly used and taught in the school, and almost
invariably our students go out earnest believers in, and workers
for, temperance, accomplishing no small amount of good among their
people, who almost universally suppose liquor necessary to laborers
and indispensable to <em>free men</em>, and therefore drink as much of it
as can be obtained.</p>

<h3>TEMPERANCE IN TEXAS.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY PRES. WM. E. BROOKS, TILLOTSON INSTITUTE.</p>

<p>It may be said with truth, I think, that the strongest temperance
element in the State of Texas to-day is among the colored people.
I am informed that where they are in the majority, and they have
an opportunity to express themselves, they vote for prohibition.
There are exceptions. They are very apt to be North or South. If we
can believe Milton, there was one in heaven once. The <em>excepting</em>
member, however, found it to his advantage to leave, if I remember
correctly. They say he came to earth. We must not wonder,
therefore, if he has some slight following among the colored people
on the whiskey question; but if they had the say, they would
largely be for prohibition.</p>

<p>Take it here at Tillotson, we have a large and flourishing society,
the members of which are pledged to total abstinence from the use
of intoxicating drinks, and of tobacco. This pledge was adopted
more than a year ago, after a prolonged discussion, but nearly
all the students are now enthusiastic members of the society. The
meetings are held on the third Sabbath evening of each month. They
are full of interest and well attended. But this, like all good
things, is the result of effort. A committee, appointed for this
purpose, has at each meeting a well-filled programme. The more
advanced students have essays upon some phase of the temperance
work; others read articles bearing on the special subject before
the meeting. Thus, at one time, the object is to make manifest the
ill effect of rum and tobacco upon the human system; at another
the cost; the whole interspersed with appropriate music, reading
the Scripture and prayer. In this way there is variety, increase
of light, and the building up of a strong, because intelligent,
opposition to intemperance. And all this is under the direction
of the students. Of course the faculty is present, to do or say
any thing that may be helpful, but the real work is done by the
students, and these meetings are not only full of interest but
reflect great credit on those that have them in charge.</p>

<p>We are thus training up a noble band of young men and women,
whose influence is sure to be felt far and wide, and to become a
great and, I trust, controlling power in Texas, especially among
the colored people. This is our aim, and that our hope shall be
realized, we are confident, since God is in the work.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></p>

<p>Thus it can be seen that the great rising tide of temperance, which
is sweeping over the North and Northwest, is making itself felt
here. Not strongly yet, but there is an underswell, a movement
among the more thoughtful, a shrinking back from the wasting,
impoverishing curse of strong drink, and from the filth and fume
of tobacco, which indicates, more clearly than words can, that
the day is close at hand, when the question of temperance, even
of prohibition, will become a living, and (may we not hope?) a
life-saving and a life-imparting issue here in this great, grand,
empire State.</p>

<h3>TOUGALOO AND TEMPERANCE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. A. HATCH, TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY.</p>

<p>Within the last four or five years, the temperance question has in
one form or another been brought before the people of Mississippi
with some prominence. The revised code is emphatic in the following
points: the sale of vinous or spirituous liquor is forbidden
except under a license, at least two hundred dollars; the sale to
minors is strictly prohibited under severe penalties; the sale of
liquor on Sunday is made unlawful, as also is the keeping open on
that day of the bar or place where liquors are sold. Two years
ago a State temperance convention was called at Jackson. This was
an intelligent body of men representing nearly every county in
the state. It adjourned without accomplishing a great deal, but
the animus of the body was strongly in favor of a constitutional
prohibitory amendment. Being an initiative movement, however, on
the ground of expediency the final action was conservative.</p>

<p>As everywhere, the liquor men are active and shrewd, gaining over
to their side many an ignorant and unwary voter. Their strong
point of influence with the colored people is connected with the
attachment of the latter to the free public school system. No
institution is more fondly cherished by any class of people in
our land than the free school system of the South by the negro
race. The State constitution provides that “all moneys received
for licenses granted for the sale of intoxicating liquor” shall
be applied toward a common school fund. The schools, indeed, are
in large part supported by this means. Liquor men accordingly put
the case thus: Prohibit the manufacture and sale of liquor in this
State and you cut off the support of the common schools.</p>

<p>In one county in the State the sale of intoxicating drinks is
entirely prohibited by the local authorities, and there is at
least one town outside of that county under a like restraint.
At the present time there is very little doing for the cause
throughout the State. It does not as yet enter into the sphere of
politics, unless prospectively in slight degree. Nothing is seen
in the leading papers relative to the subject as a matter of State
interest. Occasionally we hear of a lecturer speaking for the
cause, or rarely of some local movement in the way of organized
effort.</p>

<p>The foregoing is believed to be a fair representation of the public
mind and movement in relation to the subject. In general the
colored people are easily influenced in favor of temperance. They
are ready for the work as grain for the harvest.</p>

<p>There is need of the most earnest work. Of the 876 convicts in the
State penitentiary, according to the last official report, 782 are
colored persons, and it is estimated that four-fifths of these
committed their crimes under the influence of liquor. This fact in
the criminal list is a sure index of what is generally prevalent.
Intemperance is alarmingly widespread among the colored people
in Mississippi. The habit, too, is fixed within the churches of
this people to a shocking extent. Church membership is no sort of
guarantee that an individual is not habitually intemperate, even
to the degree of drunkenness. When we consider all this and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a> the
terrible, degrading influence resting over the children and youth,
the need of specifically <em>temperance work</em> seems almost equal to
that of Christian education.</p>

<p>What has been done in this direction by Tougaloo University through
its teachers, we take great pride and satisfaction in looking over
and summing up. During the past five years this institution has
been represented in temperance work in the State by no less than
150 different individuals converted to the cause while here, and
becoming themselves signers of the pledge to total abstinence.
These have done their temperance work in connection with the
teaching of children in the common schools, and many of them in
various fields. The little army has thus been able to reach a very
great number of children and parents and homes. Their work was
very direct. They taught the principles of temperance, and had
their total abstinence pledge for young and old to sign. Nor was
this all. All of these workers felt the necessity of exercising
from year to year as they returned to their old places, or as
circumstances made it possible, a watchful care over those induced
to sign. One year the total number of signers obtained by our
students was not less than 1,300. But this does not include the
whole of the work done. Many of our students not as yet teachers
have been energetic in their efforts to bring the subject to the
attention of friends and neighbors where they have lived and to
win these over to the cause, often gaining a greater influence and
success than many who worked as teachers.</p>

<h3>“HIGHER LAW” AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHT ON OUR SIDE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. E.&nbsp;T. HOOKER, CHARLESTON.</p>

<p>South Carolina has the <em>license</em> system, with the <em>local option</em>
attachment. One-third of the voters in any municipality may require
the question of prohibition to be submitted to the people, and a
majority prohibits. But the legislature last winter went further
than this, and in a truly paternal manner “exempted” certain towns
from the necessity of a majority for prohibition, and gave it to
a large but defeated minority. As the State power is now in the
hands of the white Democrats, it may be inferred from this action
what their temperance sentiments are, in those towns and in the
Legislature. It was a jewel of consistency also in those who now
“make no bones” of confessing, that a minority “had to” take the
government from the (colored) majority a few years ago. It was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum jus</i> made legal in spite of republican principles—and was
opposed on that ground by some—which is perhaps symptomatic of
certain peculiarities of the South Carolina people, that have not
always pleased the rest of the country so well. But we will not
quarrel with them this time.</p>

<p>Also the tendency is to make licenses high and higher. They cost
$225 in Charleston, and it has been proposed to raise the figure
thirty per cent.</p>

<p>A daily reader of the <cite>News and Courier</cite> is almost constantly
seeing instances, noticed with approval, of the success of the
local option law, with such headings as “Greenville doesn’t want
any in her’s.” “Sumter will go dry.” And to-day’s paper, March 21,
states that <a id="Err2" name="Err2"></a>“the W.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;U. has induced several of the teachers
in Spartanburg, [where are the school board? We are a free country
down here, after all.] to introduce text books on temperance. The
cause is having a boom in S.</p>

<p>Mrs. L. Chapin, of Charleston, is President of the Union; and not
long ago they held a busy and thronged session of days, in the hall
of our aristocratic military company in this city. The delegates
from abroad were not wined, but dined and fêted, shown the harbor
and the forts by our city worthies, all with great cordiality and
éclat. More recently still, Hibernian Hall has been twice filled,
as seldom for any political cause, once to hear Miss F.&nbsp;E. Willard,
and, since her visit, Mrs. Foster. Messrs. Stearns and Mead are
coming next week from a busy campaign south and west of us, to hold
two meetings in two of the largest colored churches, and will have
big crowds.</p>

<p>Nearly every grocery in Charleston is also a liquor store; but few
keep bars; and the saloons proper are not numerous. This shows
that most of the drinking is in a domestic and quiet way, and
not on an empty stomach, <em>standing up</em>. Beer is not sold in such
large proportion as in Northern cities, but distilled or fermented
liquors, and beer carts are not absent. There is yet a “smart
chance” of illicit distilling in the up-country, and of unlicensed
selling in the backwoods.</p>

<p>On public days not much intoxication is visible. Christmas, also
observed with heathen fire crackers, is the day of greatest
indulgence in firewater, especially among the blacks. But it is
said that the colored men very seldom become drunkards. Their
drinking is occasional rather than habitual, and when intoxicated
they are not combative, but weak and nerveless, or garrulous; while
the up-country man (white), when in liquor, with or without his
pistol, is bellicose in the extreme.</p>

<p>An incident is in place here, which may be called the last spark
of light in the morally dark closing hours of the late House of
Representatives at Washington. It relates to both the colored race
here and the temperance interest.</p>

<p>Sam Lee, a colored man, of good character it may be inferred,
partly from the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a> fact that the <cite>News and Courier</cite> has not loaded
him with obloquy, true or false, had been for two years contesting
the seat occupied by one Richardson, who, it was voted in the last
hours of that dubious session, was not the choice of his district,
but Lee was. The long-pending whiskey bill, virtually giving
millions from the United States Treasury to the lobby, who had
pushed it through the Senate, was the next thing on the calendar. A
formality remained to be accomplished giving Lee actual possession
of his seat and pay. Over this the Democrats were filibustering,
when the whiskey lobby offered Lee $15,000 to withdraw his claim
and permit their bill to come on, which they had reason to expect
would pass. But, no! He would stand for his right and <em>the</em> right,
and thus did more good for the temperance cause in his few moments
of legal, but unpaid, membership of the House, than possibly he
might have done in a long session, for that or any other cause. The
fact is worth preserving, to the praise of a mighty Providence,
that used that Sabbath morning to defeat one grand move of Satan,
and by means of a colored man from South Carolina, sticking to a
right which he would not exchange for whiskey money.</p>

<h3>NOTES AT THE ALABAMA STATE SUNDAY-SCHOOL CONVENTION, MARCH 23.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. A.&nbsp;W. CURTIS, MARION.</p>

<p>At Alabama Furnace, there is much interest on temperance in the
Sunday-School, and frequent talks on the subject in church.</p>

<p>Mobile. Temperance organization growing, also the sentiment against
the use of tobacco.</p>

<p>Shelby Iron Works. Temperance society doing well. Whiskey has been
driven out of the beat for nearly a year.</p>

<p>The Cove. There is a temperance society of 46 members. The children
have turned their backs on strong drink, tobacco and snuff.</p>

<p>King’s Chapel has a temperance society of 34 members, and is
struggling against whiskey, but so many love it that the fight goes
hard.</p>

<p>Childersburg. Rev. A. Jones had his church burned after giving a
temperance lecture, but instead of surrendering, his people have
rallied and they are building better than before.</p>

<p>At Lawson, the pastor has preached against liquor drinking, but
can do very little to stay the tide. There is a vast deal of
drunkenness. Men will buy whiskey first, meat and bread afterwards
if there is money enough for both.</p>

<p>At Marion, there is a regular temperance catechising in the
day-school against rum and tobacco, also in the three mission
Sunday-schools, frequent preaching on the subject, and mass
meetings alternating at the different churches <a id="Err3" name="Err3"></a>for free discussion
for some weeks before Christmas.</p>

<p>Montgomery. Doing thorough work in temperance, especially in the
Sunday-school, using the Careful Builders and other literature of
Dr. Cook’s temperance library. The same is true of Selma where they
are also putting in strong licks for temperance in the Burrell
day-school. Here, too, temperance concerts and recitations are
frequent.</p>

<p>Talladega. Their Union Temperance Society holds monthly meetings
full of interest. All of the Sunday-school and all the college
students are members, many of the students going out into the
neighboring beats to lecture. They keep the work lively among
all their mission schools. Next August comes the test vote for
prohibition.</p>

<h3>TEMPERANCE AMONG OUR CHINESE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. W.&nbsp;C. POND.</p>

<p>The Chinese have never patronized to any appreciable extent the
saloons of California. It is shrewdly suspected that this is the
very front of their offending. If the money these laborers earned
went into the tills of our liquor dealers, the conventions these
liquor dealers so largely control would look at the laborers
themselves with different eyes. But a Chinaman asked to drink
replies (so the story goes): “Me no drinkee whiskee. Make one
Chinaman allee same Melican, No. 1 fool.”</p>

HOODLUMS AT STREET CORNER, SAN FRANCISCO
</div>

<p>I think, however, that American civilization is at last making
itself felt among our Chinese, for I believe that I have passed, in
this city, one small saloon where a Chinaman stood behind the bar,
and some of his countrymen in front of it. I never saw a Chinaman
drunk, though I have heard that the sight might be seen. But this,
too, is recent, and my impression of the aversion to intoxicating
drinks, as a national characteristic, was, till lately, so strong,
that for many years I had nothing to say to our Christian Chinese
on the subject, except as it came up incidentally<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a> in the course
of Bible study. It is within a year that it came to my knowledge
that a stimulating and slightly intoxicating drink, which they
call in English, wine, is made from rice, and used among them
more or less at banquets, though not, I think, at ordinary meals.
The discovery of this fact, and that even our most advanced and
reliable Christians were not total abstainers, has led us to preach
among them this gospel also. It has been readily accepted. The
duty, under <em>our</em> circumstances, of <em>total</em> abstinence seems to
be understood, and duty understood becomes, I believe, with these
brethren, unquestioned law.</p>

<p>Respecting opium, the voice of the mission has from the first been
clear, positive and unmistakable. I cannot claim that we have
reached many who had become addicted to this vice; indeed, I cannot
now recall one among those whom I have baptized who had used the
drug enough to make it hard to do without it. Generally I have been
told that they have never used it at all. It ought perhaps to be
a shame to us that we have not reached and rescued slaves to this
vice. Certainly, if any door should open by which an effectual work
of this sort could be set forward, it ought to be entered upon with
intensest zeal. But the most that we have seen it possible to do
thus far has been to pledge all who come into our Congregational
Association of Christian Chinese, not to gamble and not to use
opium. These are the items of external conduct upon which special
emphasis is laid. A brother overtaken in either of these faults
would be dealt with at once in a discipline, the chief danger of
which would be that it might be too prompt and too severe: a zeal
to make the protest of the brotherhood against the sin decisive
and unmistakable preventing due patience and long suffering in the
effort to “restore” and “gain” the erring one.</p>

<h3>SEQUEL TO TED’S TEMPERANCE SOCIETY.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MRS. THOS. N. CHASE.</p>

<p>Now, children, I shouldn’t a bit wonder if some of you remember a
story about Ted’s Temperance Society written for the Children’s
Page a year ago. If you have the Missionary for June, 1882, just
read it again, then you will enjoy this story better. Ted, you
remember, was a real live Atlanta boy, ten years old, who got his
school-mates to come to his home to sign a pledge. Ted’s mother
often helped him in making the children who came fully understand
what a solemn thing they were doing. She read the pledge very
slowly to each. Then she had them sign their names on a little
card, and some other child must put down another name underneath
as a witness. This was all there was to the Society, so simple
and easy that any child could do it, no bands, badges, banners or
prizes, yet they were so interested that they came in scores to
enroll their names, and the best of all was, that many who signed
seemed to catch Ted’s missionary zeal, and became centres of little
circles which they drew into Ted’s home, to help swell the noble
army marching against the cruel old despots, tobacco and whiskey.</p>

<p>One little fellow, who had brought many before, came one day with
an overgrown girl of fifteen, and finding several new boys in
the house ready to take the pledge, he felt the dignity of the
situation and tried to help Ted’s mother in her little sermon by
shouting: “Now, boys, this is a good thing if you only mean to keep
it, but it don’t do to put your name down here for a form or a
fashion.”</p>

<p>I recently met dashing little Susie Hall. I knew her as one of the
head centres of those temperance circles. How her black eyes danced
as she told me of her<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a> contempt for mince-pies, egg-nog, etc. Few
Southern cooks know how to make mince-pies without brandy. I asked
Susie who gave her the egg-nog she told me of refusing so bravely.
“Oh, ma cooks for white folks and we lives in the yard, and on
Christmas the white lady called me to scrape out the bowl, but I
couldn’t touch it.”</p>

<p>I have just come in from a visit to the Gate City Grammar School,
an eight room city school for colored children, all the teachers
being former students of Atlanta University. I noticed upon the
wall of each room, as soon as I entered a sheet of fools-cap with
names written upon it. For a border it had the beautiful rainbow
pasting which the children in the Storrs Kindergarten make. As
the brilliant setting of those names caught my eye, I supposed
it was some roll of honor, and so it was, but it seemed to me an
enrollment of honor far greater than that given for perfection
in scholarship or school deportment. This is the heading. “We,
the undersigned, do promise not to drink, or ask others to drink,
any wine, cider, whiskey, beer, egg-nog, or anything that can
intoxicate, from this day, Dec. 18, 1882, to Feb. 1, 1883.” From
Dec. 18, to Feb. 1, is only six weeks to be sure, so this is only
a bridge-pledge to bridge over that awful chasm which yawns and
buries so many during those fearful days of the old and new year
when we honor the birthday of the Christ-child, and which ought to
be the purest of all the year. If the children get safely through
these feasting days of egg-nog, brandy-peaches, and syllabubs, they
are pretty safe the rest of the year.</p>

<p>Ted’s Society has a growing mission. I take courage as I think of
Hale’s beautiful story, “Ten Times One is Ten,” and see how easily
these children can carry on a grand temperance work, and</p>

<h2>PROPOSED CONSTITUTION OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This society shall be called the American
Missionary Association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association shall be to
conduct Christian missionary and educational operations and diffuse
a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other countries
which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent
fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Members may be constituted for life by the
payment of thirty dollars into the treasury of the Association,
with the written declaration at the time or times of payment that
the sum is to be applied to constitute a designated person a life
member; and such membership shall begin sixty days after the
payment shall have been completed.</p>

<p>Every church which has within a year contributed to the funds of
the Association and every State Conference or Association of such
churches may appoint two delegates to the Annual Meeting of the
Association; such delegates, duly attested by credentials, shall be
members of the Association for the year for which they were thus
appointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> The Annual Meeting of the Association shall be
held in the month of October or November, at such time and place as
may be designated by the Executive Committee, by notice printed in
the official publication of the Association for the preceding month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The officers of the Association shall be a
President, five Vice-Presidents, a Corresponding Secretary or
Secretaries, a Recording Secretary, a Treasurer, Auditors, and
an Executive Committee of fifteen members, all of whom shall be
elected by ballot.</p>

<p>At the first Annual Meeting after the adoption of this
Constitution, five members of the Executive Committee shall be
elected for the term of one year, five for two years and five for
three years, and at each subsequent Annual Meeting, five members
shall be elected for the full term of three years, and such others
as shall be required to fill vacancies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> To the Executive Committee shall belong the
collecting and disbursing of funds, the appointing, counseling,
sustaining and dismissing of missionaries and agents, and the
selection of missionary fields. They shall have authority to fill
all vacancies in office occurring between the Annual Meetings;
to apply to any Legislature for acts of incorporation, or
conferring corporate power; to make provision when necessary for
disabled missionaries and for the widows and children of deceased
missionaries, and in general to transact all such business as
usually appertains to the Executive Committees of missionary and
other benevolent societies. The acts of the Committee shall be
subject to the revision of the Annual Meeting.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee constitute a quorum for transacting
business.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> No person shall be made an officer of this
Association who is not a member of some evangelical church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> Missionary bodies and churches or individuals
may appoint and sustain missionaries of their own, through the
agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> No amendment shall be made to this Constitution
except by the vote of two-thirds of the members present at an
Annual Meeting, the amendment having been approved by the vote of a
majority at the previous Annual Meeting.</p>

</div>

<p class="small">We are the <b>General Agents</b> for the United States and
Canada for this wonderful and <b>First Class</b> Organette. It
is a <b>reed</b> instrument, and is constructed on the same
principle as an organ, with bellows and <b>full size reeds</b>.
The music consists of perforated sheets, which are put into the
Organette, furnishing either <b>finished solo performance, a rich
accompaniment to the voice or valuable orchestral effects</b>. They
are marvels of musical invention, and combine in themselves all
the principles upon which automatic organs, organettes, etc., are
now being made, requiring no skill in the performer; any child old
enough to use its hands intelligently can play, and the <b>range
of music is absolutely unlimited</b>. We wish to introduce one of
these Organettes in every town and hamlet throughout the <b>United
States and Canada</b>, and in order to do so <b>speedily</b> have
concluded to sell a limited number to the readers of this magazine
at <b>ONLY $5.00</b> each. This is <b>much under the regular
price</b>, and in order to protect ourselves from persons ordering
in large quantities we require you to <b>cut this advertisement
out</b> and send to us with your order on or before <b>September
1st, 1883</b>. We will positively not sell more than <b>one
Organette</b> to any one person at this reduced price, as we only
make this unprecedented offer to introduce this <b>first-class
Organette</b> throughout the world, well knowing that, after one is
received in a neighborhood, we will sell several at <b>our regular
price</b>.</p>

<p class="small">We wish to caution you against the many <b>worthless automatic
instruments</b> being sold <b>under various names</b>. We are
the <b>General Agents</b> for the <b>McTammany Organette</b>,
and you must order direct from us or through our authorized
Agents. Remember, the <b>McTammany Organettes</b> are not toys,
but are <b>large and powerful instruments</b>, built of <b>black
walnut</b>, highly polished and decorated in <b>gold</b>, the
Reeds being so powerful that they produce sufficient <b>volume of
music</b> for the <b>chapel, parlor or lodge</b>. There is nothing
about them to get out of order, in fact, they produce a richer and
sweeter sound after having been used for a few years. <b>For HOME
ENTERTAINMENTS they are unsurpassed.</b> The cut will give you
but a faint idea of <em>size and finish</em> of this instrument, but we
will return the money and pay express charges to any one who is
not perfectly satisfied after receiving it. With each Organette we
inclose a selection of popular tunes, and pack all in a strong box.
Money can be sent by Registered Letter, Money Order or Draft, or we
will send the Organette by express, C.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;D., with the privilege of
examination before taking out of the express office, if you send
$1, to guarantee us against express charges. If you are in New York
at any time call on us, or if you have friends living here request
them to call and purchase for you. If you wish to act as an agent
for us send to us at once and secure the agency for your town.
<b>You can easily sell the instruments at $10 to $15 each. Address
or call on</b></p>

<p class="center xxxlarge">COMPOUND OXYGEN,</p>

<p class="center large">FOR THE CURE OF CHRONIC DISEASES.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="center"><b>“I Almost Forget that I Have Been Sick.”</b></p>

<p class="medium">This is the declaration of a lady in Wellsville, Mo., whose
friends, to use her own words, “had all given up that I was going
with <em>Consumption</em> as fast as I could.” We give her own account of
the marvelous change wrought by Compound Oxygen:</p>

<p class="medium">“I was convalescing from a six weeks’ fever when I began using
the Oxygen. Was very much reduced in flesh and strength; could
only sit up a part of the time. Had a slight cough and raised some
matter and phlegm from my lungs. After using the Oxygen one week my
weight was eighty nine and a half pounds; three weeks after it was
ninety-two pounds, a gain of two and a half pounds in three weeks.
I think it has been much faster for the last two weeks.</p>

<p class="medium">“I have been using Oxygen for six weeks and am now able to ride to
town, six miles, do my shopping and back again, get dinner for my
family and work at light housework all the remainder of the day
without stopping to rest. Am feeling so strong and well <em>that I
almost forget I have been sick</em> and should think my lungs well if
it were not for the smarting or uneasy feeling in my throat and
some pain between my shoulders at times.</p>

<p class="medium">“My cough (when I do cough, which is not often) is much more
satisfactory and less of a hack than it was six weeks ago, and I
think I raise more phlegm and less matter.</p>

<p class="medium">“I am able to do my own work, and it is so easy that I find it a
real pleasure. <em>Appetite is splendid. Sleep seven or eight hours
soundly; no night sweats, no distressing sick headaches, as I
used to have. My friends had all given up that I was going with
Consumption as fast as I could, but instead, I am looking better
than for years</em>, and I think it is through God’s mercy and His
blessing and your Oxygen that has brought me health and happiness.”</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p class="center"><b>“A Wonder to all my Friends.”</b></p>

<p class="medium">A lady at Sandy Creek, N.Y., wrote us in April last, giving a
statement of her case. She had been a sufferer for many years,
especially from <em>Neuralgia</em>.</p>

<p class="medium">We had but one report of the case, and that a brief one, until
October 20, 1882, when the following was received. It will be seen
that the treatment has been doing a good work, and that the lady,
to use her own words, is “a wonder to all her friends.”</p>

<p class="medium">“Last April I procured a Home Treatment from you and have written
you once since then. I have been greatly benefited by the use of
the Oxygen. When I wrote you a description of my case you expressed
the opinion that with freedom from care and work I might be cured
by taking the Treatment. I have never worked so hard or steadily
as through the past summer, <em>and have not felt so well, so much
alive for years</em>, and all this from the use <em>of only about half
a Treatment</em>. I have been so very busy that I have not taken the
Oxygen regularly at all; neither have I reported to you but once
before, so I could blame no one but myself if I were not benefited.
I have not felt quite as well for the past two weeks, but am
going to be more faithful in the use of the Oxygen, and I hope to
improve. <em>I am a wonder to all my friends</em>, but I give the credit
where it is due—to the use of the Oxygen.”</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p class="center"><b>Strong Testimony from a Physician.</b></p>

<p class="medium">A physician in Troy, Tenn., whose wife was in the early stages of
Consumption, wrote to us in May last, ordering a Treatment. In a
second letter, received some weeks after the Compound Oxygen was
received, he says:</p>

<p class="medium">“She coughs some. Has no night sweats. Had some chills lately;
short breath; pain in left lung under breast; some hemorrhage
recently; appetite and sleep moderate; losing flesh since using
Compound Oxygen; is some better in all respects; coughs up some
blood and pure pus; breathes better than before using Compound
Oxygen.”</p>

<p class="medium">We did not hear again from the case until Sept. 22, 1882, when a
letter came, in which the writer states that he had been waiting
to see if the good work begun by our Treatment was going to be
permanent. His report, which we give below, is highly satisfactory:</p>

<p class="medium">“You will no doubt think that I have been very negligent in writing
you in regard to my wife’s case. Please receive my apology. <em>I
was just waiting to see if what your Treatment was doing would be
permanent.</em> I have so much to say that I hardly know where to begin.</p>

<p class="medium">“I gave you the symptoms when I made the order. <em>For the first
three weeks my wife did not improve any. After that time she
improved slowly but steadily. She is now like a new person. She is
gaining all the time. Her breathing is better than for two years,
and she is gaining strength and flesh.</em></p>

<p class="medium">“When she began your Compound Oxygen <em>she could not walk fifty
yards without great exhaustion</em>. She can now <em>walk half a mile with
but little fatigue</em>. Her lungs pain her but little. She sleeps well
at night; appetite good; has not <em>had any hemorrhage since last of
July</em>, and then light; and, to cut the matter short, <em>she said this
morning that she began to feel like herself again</em>.</p>

<p class="medium">“<em>You are at liberty to refer to me or my wife any one similarly
affected.</em>”</p>

<p class="medium">Our Treatise on Compound Oxygen <em>is sent free of charge</em>. It
contains a history of the discovery, nature and action of this new
remedy, and a record of many of the remarkable results which have
so far attended its use.</p>
